# webroot_swift_demo

Welcome to my demo of introductory exposure to the Swift programming language.

## Prompt

This demo is in response to the following prompt:

> In Swift, write a function that:
>
> 1. Takes an arbitrary string as its first parameter.
> 2. Takes a sequence of non-repeating characters as its second parameter.
> 3. Returns how many times each of the characters from #2 was present in #1.

## Assumptions

- For prompt item 2, a "sequence of non-repeating characters" is synonymous with a string of non-repeating characters.
- The character analysis is case-sensitive. (i.e. A count towards W is not the same as a count towards w.)
- It is acceptable that the order of count information is non-deterministic.
